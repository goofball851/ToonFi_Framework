# Lab Cycles

ToonFi runs in loose cycles.

A cycle is just a period where certain things are active.

## What Changes in a Cycle

A cycle might:
- Rotate available resources
- Introduce new experiments
- Retire old ones
- Shift visuals or tone

Cycles help keep things from becoming static.

## After a Cycle Ends

Old cycles don’t disappear.
They become history.

Logs, artifacts, and outcomes may remain visible.
