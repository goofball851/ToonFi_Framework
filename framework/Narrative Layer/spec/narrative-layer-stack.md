# Narrative Layer Stack
**Specification v1.0**

A framework layer defining how meaning persists after a story concludes.

---

## 1. Purpose

The Narrative Layer Stack defines **post-story existence**.

It activates only after an authored narrative has ended.

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. Stories are finite  
2. Characters are persistent  
3. Interaction is additive, not authoritative  
4. Motion implies existence  
5. Nothing waits for the user  

Violation of any principle breaks compatibility.

---

## 3. Story Boundary Rule

Every project must define a **Story Boundary**:
- a clear ending
- resolved stakes
- locked meaning

After the Story Boundary:
- no rewrites
- no branching canon
- no escalation

The Narrative Layer Stack operates **only after this boundary**.

---

## 4. Post-Story Existence States

All post-boundary behavior must resolve into one or more:

### Echo
- remains in original world
- routine continuation
- consequence without escalation

### Reframe
- restarts differently
- new role or context
- same core identity

### Displacement
- exists elsewhere
- familiar but altered
- not a sequel

No additional state types are permitted.

---

## 5. Persistence Model

Persistence is **state-based**, not stat-based.

### Allowed
- mood
- habits
- awareness
- presence
- silence
- wear
- drift

### Disallowed
- XP
- levels
- power scaling
- skill trees
- optimization loops

---

## 6. Unlockables

Unlockables are allowed only if they:
- do not alter canon
- do not answer unresolved plot questions
- do not create new story events
- do not grant authority

Rule:
> **More rooms, not a new building.**

---

## 7. Monetization Guardrail

Allowed:
- access
- observation
- perspective
- permanence

Forbidden:
- pay-to-decide
- pay-to-progress
- pay-to-control

---

## 8. UI Philosophy — Continuous Motion Principle

> **All characters and items must remain in motion through interaction.**

Motion means continuity of state, not animation playback.

A static image is compliant only if interaction reveals it is not truly still.

---

## 9. Final Existence Test

> If the user leaves forever, does the character still exist meaningfully?

If yes → compliant  
If no → not Narrative Layer compatible
