# Narrative Layer Stack — Compliance Checklist

A project is compatible only if **all** items pass.

---

## Story
- [ ] Story Boundary is defined
- [ ] Canon is locked post-boundary
- [ ] No branching or rewrites

---

## Persistence
- [ ] Character persists without user command
- [ ] Persistence is state-based, not stat-based
- [ ] No escalation mechanics

---

## Interaction
- [ ] Interaction reveals, never directs
- [ ] No play/start/stop metaphors
- [ ] No resets

---

## UI
- [ ] Continuous Motion Principle enforced
- [ ] Static elements imply ongoing existence
- [ ] Revisit ≠ repeat

---

## Unlockables & Monetization
- [ ] Unlockables add possibility, not authority
- [ ] No pay-to-control mechanics

---

Failure of any item breaks compatibility.
