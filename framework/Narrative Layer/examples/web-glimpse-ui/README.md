# Web Example — Glimpse UI

<img width="400" height="400" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_ylodv4ylodv4ylod" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a66bb7a-3490-490a-a199-acaeebce2bf5" />

This example demonstrates a Narrative Layer–compliant web interface.

---

## Concept

A single image behaves as a **window into an ongoing world**.

- No play button
- No animation trigger
- No reset

Interaction reveals continuity.

---

## Compliant Behaviors

- hover → awareness shift
- click → perspective change
- time → subtle drift
- revisit ≠ repeat

---

## What This Is Not

- not a gallery
- not a splash screen
- not a portfolio

It is a **glimpse**.
