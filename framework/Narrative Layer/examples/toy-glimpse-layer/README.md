This example shows how a physical object can comply with the Narrative Layer Stack.

## Concept

A collectible exists as a snapshot of an ongoing world.

Scanning the toy does not activate content — it **reveals context**.

---

## Physical Components

- Toy (static object)
- QR or NFC
- Packaging copy

---

## Digital Reveal

- existence state (Echo / Reframe / Displacement)
- observations
- subtle variation over time

---

## Disallowed

- choosing outcomes
- upgrading behavior
- unlocking canon events

The toy does not perform.  
It continues.
