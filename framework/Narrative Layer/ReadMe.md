A framework layer for building character- and world-based experiences where  
**stories end, but existence continues**.

This repository defines a **logic standard**, not a style guide.

## What is the Narrative Layer Stack?

The Narrative Layer Stack governs what happens **after a story is finished**.

It applies to:
- web experiences
- physical products
- collectibles
- NFTs
- AI systems
- interactive interfaces

It does **not**:
- generate plot
- branch canon
- optimize engagement
- reward control

## Core Promise

> **Stories are finite.  
> Characters are persistent.  
> Interaction reveals—never directs.**
