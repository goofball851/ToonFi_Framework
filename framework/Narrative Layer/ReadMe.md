<img width="500" height="500" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_xh3xg2xh3xg2xh3x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/243a18eb-67a9-4b8f-8432-5c70d92d050a" />

A framework layer for building character- and world-based experiences where  
**stories end, but existence continues**.

This repository defines a **logic standard**, not a style guide.

## What is the Narrative Layer Stack?

The Narrative Layer Stack governs what happens **after a story is finished**.

It applies to:
- web experiences
- physical products
- collectibles
- NFTs
- AI systems
- interactive interfaces

It does **not**:
- generate plot
- branch canon
- optimize engagement
- reward control

## Core Promise

> **Stories are finite.  
> Characters are persistent.  
> Interaction reveals—never directs.**
