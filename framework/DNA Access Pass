# DNA Access Pass

The DNA Access Pass is a high-level identity-style NFT.

Think of it as a long-running badge rather than a key.

## What It Does

At a basic level, the DNA Pass:
- Represents ongoing participation
- Connects different ToonFi experiences
- May change visually or descriptively over time

It helps tie things together.

## What It Doesn’t Do

The DNA Pass does not:
- Guarantee perks
- Lock in value
- Promise future content
- Act as a status symbol

It’s about continuity, not exclusivity.
