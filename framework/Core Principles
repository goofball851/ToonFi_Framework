# Core Principles

These aren’t rules.
They’re tendencies.

If something breaks one of these later, that’s fine.

## Play Comes First

If something isn’t fun to interact with, it probably doesn’t belong.
Optimization comes later — if at all.

---

## Discovery Beats Instruction

People should learn by clicking, playing, or poking around.
Clear explanations are optional.
Curiosity is required.

---

## Ownership Is About Context

Owning something in ToonFi usually means:
- You see more
- You carry history
- You unlock context

Not power.
Not status.

---

## Change Is Normal

Characters evolve.
Rules shift.
Systems get retired.

Stability is not the goal.

---

## Humor Is a Feature

Slightly broken behavior is allowed.
Weird outcomes are welcome.
Not everything needs to be serious or efficient.
