# Framework

This folder contains the core ideas behind the ToonFi framework.

Nothing here is meant to be final or perfectly defined.
These files describe how things *tend* to work, not how they must work.

Think of this folder as:
- A shared vocabulary
- A set of patterns
- A reference point for future experiments

## What You’ll Find Here

Each file focuses on a different part of the framework:

- **core_principles.md**  
  The general mindset behind ToonFi.  
  These ideas guide decisions more than they enforce rules.
  
- **interactive_lore.md**  
  How ToonFi treats stories as finished, but characters as ongoing.
  This is the emotional core of the framework.

- **interaction_layers.md**  
  Different ways people might interact with ToonFi — from just looking around to owning things.

- **coins.md**  
  How in-world coins are treated as interaction tools, not currency.

- **nfts.md**  
  How NFTs behave more like objects or characters than collectibles.

- **dna_access_pass.md**  
  A high-level look at the DNA Access Pass and what it represents.

- **evolution_models.md**  
  How things change over time instead of leveling up.

- **lab_cycles.md**  
  How ToonFi uses cycles to keep systems from becoming static.

## How to Use These Files

You don’t need to read them in order.

- Skim what’s interesting
- Ignore what isn’t relevant yet
- Come back later if something changes

These files are meant to be referenced, not memorized.

## A Note on Flexibility

If something in this folder feels vague, that’s intentional.

The framework is designed to leave room for:
- Play
- Experimentation
- Failure
- Unexpected outcomes

Clarity is important — rigidity isn’t.

---

## In Short

This folder explains *how ToonFi thinks*.

Not how it ships.
Not how it monetizes.
Not how it guarantees outcomes.

Just how the pieces tend to fit together.
