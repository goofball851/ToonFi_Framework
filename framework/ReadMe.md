This folder contains the core ideas behind the ToonFi framework.

Nothing here is meant to be final or perfectly defined.
These files describe how things *tend* to work, not how they must work.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

Each file focuses on a different part of the framework:

- `Core Principles`  
  The general mindset behind ToonFi.  
  These ideas guide decisions more than they enforce rules.
  
- `Interactive Lore` 
  How ToonFi treats stories as finished, but characters as ongoing.
  This is the emotional core of the framework.

- `NFTs`  
  How NFTs behave more like objects or characters than collectibles.
  
- `Coins`  
  How in-world coins are treated as interaction tools, not currency.

- `DNA Access Pass`  
  A high-level look at the DNA Access Pass and what it represents.

- `Evolution Models`  
  How things change over time instead of leveling up.

- `Lab Cycles`  
  How ToonFi uses cycles to keep systems from becoming static.
  
- `Interaction Layers` 
  Different ways people might interact with ToonFi — from just looking around to owning things.

## How to Use These Files

You don’t need to read them in order.

- Skim what’s interesting
- Ignore what isn’t relevant yet
- Come back later if something changes

These files are meant to be referenced, not memorized.

## A Note on Flexibility

If something in this folder feels vague, that’s intentional.

The framework is designed to leave room for:
- Play
- Experimentation
- Failure
- Unexpected outcomes

Clarity is important — rigidity isn’t.

---

## In Short

This folder explains *how ToonFi thinks*.

Not how it ships.
Not how it monetizes.
Not how it guarantees outcomes.

Just how the pieces tend to fit together.
