# Evolution Models

Most things in ToonFi evolve instead of leveling up.

Evolution describes change, not power growth.

---

## Guided / Incubated Changes

These changes are:
- More controlled
- Resource-driven
- Predictable

Useful when someone wants a specific outcome.

---

## Natural Changes

Natural evolution:
- Happens over time
- Is less predictable
- Can pass through multiple states

Sometimes it produces unexpected results.

---

## Unexpected Outcomes

Some outcomes happen because of:
- Timing
- Transfers
- Misuse
- Interruption

These are usually rare and not repeatable.
