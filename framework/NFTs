# NFTs

NFTs in ToonFi act like persistent objects rather than collectibles.

They’re meant to behave more like characters, tools, or artifacts.

## What NFTs Might Represent

- Characters
- Access passes
- Experiments
- Gadgets or strange objects

## How NFTs Behave

NFTs may:
- Change over time
- Pick up history
- Unlock interactions
- Carry context across projects

They’re allowed to evolve, glitch, or settle into weird states.

## Ownership Notes

Owning an NFT doesn’t guarantee:
- Rewards
- Value
- Priority access

It just means you’re carrying something forward.
