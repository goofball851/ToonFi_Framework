# Contributing to ToonFi

Thanks for checking out ToonFi.

This repository documents ideas, patterns, and experiments related to the ToonFi framework. Contributions are welcome, but the scope is intentionally limited.

Please read this before opening an issue or pull request.

## What This Repo Is For

This repo exists to:
- Document ToonFi’s design logic
- Share high-level system ideas
- Track observations and experiments
- Maintain a consistent tone and philosophy

It is not a place for:
- Feature requests tied to timelines
- Tokenomics proposals
- Financial or investment discussion
- Technical implementation demands

---

## Types of Contributions That Make Sense

We’re open to contributions that:
- Clarify language or improve readability
- Fix typos or formatting issues
- Suggest alternative wording or framing
- Add examples that fit existing sections
- Ask thoughtful questions about design intent

These are considered **discussion-level contributions**, not development tasks.

---

## Types of Contributions That Don’t Fit

Please avoid:
- Requests for guaranteed features or utilities
- Roadmap pressure or deadlines
- Chain-specific recommendations
- Price, value, or ROI discussions
- “You should launch X” proposals

Those topics may be relevant elsewhere, but not in this repo.

## How to Contribute

### Issues
- Use issues to ask questions or suggest improvements
- Keep discussions focused on the framework itself
- Be concise and respectful

### Pull Requests
- Keep changes small and scoped
- One topic per PR
- Explain *why* the change improves clarity or intent
- Expect edits or rejection — that’s normal

Not all contributions will be merged.

## Tone & Style Guidelines

Please keep contributions:
- Casual and readable
- Free of hype language
- Free of marketing or sales tone
- Aligned with the experimental nature of ToonFi

If something sounds like a pitch, it probably doesn’t fit.
