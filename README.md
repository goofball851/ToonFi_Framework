# 🧪 ToonFi Framework

A casual framework for cartoon worlds, experiments, and internet-native play.

## What is ToonFi?

ToonFi is a loose framework for building cartoon-driven worlds where characters, gadgets, and systems change over time.

It mixes:
- Cartoons and animation logic  
- Game-style progression  
- Interactive web experiences  
- Simple coins and unlocks  
- Digital collectibles (NFTs)  

This repository isn’t a product manual or a promise of features.
It’s a collection of shared notes on how ToonFi *tends* to behave.

Some ideas will evolve.
Some will break.
Some will disappear entirely.

That’s expected.

## What This Is / Isn’t

### This *is*:
- A reference for ToonFi’s design logic
- A place to document experiments and patterns
- A shared vocabulary for future projects

### This is *not*:
- A roadmap
- A whitepaper
- Financial advice
- A guarantee of features or rewards

Nothing here should be treated as final.

## How to Read This Repo

- Start with `/framework/core_principles.md`
- Everything else builds loosely on that
- Logs are observations, not patch notes

You don’t need to read it all in order.
Jump around.

## Current Status

- Experimental  
- In progress  
- Open to change

## Final Note

ToonFi isn’t one thing.
It’s a system for making systems — with cartoons doing most of the explaining.
A casual framework for cartoon worlds, experiments, and internet-native play through Web2 and Web3 platforms.
