# Cycle 00 – Pre-Observation Notes

This cycle exists mostly to document early ideas.

Nothing here is stable.
Nothing here is guaranteed.

## Observations

- Systems feel better when slightly under-explained
- Small interactions create more engagement than big promises
- Watching things change is often more fun than controlling them

---

## Known Unknowns

- How much structure is too much
- When to remove systems instead of expanding them
- How long something should exist before evolving

---

## Notes

Some experiments won’t make it past this phase.
That’s fine.
